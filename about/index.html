                        <p>This course, Introduction to Web Development, is brought to you by 
                           <a href="https://www.missionbit.com">Mission Bit</a>, a nonproft organization 
                           based in San Francisco.  According to their mission statement:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          <blockquote>
                            Mission Bit strives to eliminate the tech divide for youth 
                            living in urban poverty and rural areas across the San Francisco Bay Area by 
                            building computer programming and professional opportunity pathways for public school students.
                          </blockquote>
                        </p>
                        <p>To this end, this course strives to engage students by offering a variety of fun 
                          and creative projects, exploring web design through peer to peer collaboration.  
                          The skills we'll use are essential for nearly all engineers, developers, and 
                          people working with computers, and impact all of our lives on a daily basis.  
                          Students will work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>, 
                          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>, 
                          and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> 
                          and can use these languages as a stepping stone to following their own pathways in computer science.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Beyond computer science, students will develop many other life skills, such as team work 
                          and peer skills, overcoming obstacles and solving problems, developing a positive growth 
                          mindset, and using planning and focus to accomplish goals.
                        </p>
