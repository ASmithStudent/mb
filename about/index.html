                        <p>
                          Greg Gorlen holds a BA in Political Science from <a href="http://www.sfsu.edu/">San 
                          Francisco State University</a> and a variety of certificates in Computer Science from
                          <a href="http://www.ccsf.edu/">City College of San Francisco</a>. By day, he's a  
                          library assistant at the <a href="http://sfpl.org/">San Francisco Public Library</a>.  
                          His programming journey began in 2015, when he enrolled at CCSF and began exploring
                          games, puzzles, Twitter bots, web scraping, and a variety of other adventures in code.  
                          He also works as a teacher's assistant and tutor while leading Mission Bit classes.

                          programming</a> by working in groups

                          Beyond computer science, students will develop many other life skills, such as team work 
                          and peer skills, overcoming obstacles and solving problems, developing a positive growth 
                          mindset, and using planning and focus to accomplish goals.

                          This course assumes no prior knowledge other than internet browsing/computer skills, keyboard and mouse skills,
                          the ability to follow detailed instructions, and the ability to apply logic to solve problems 
                          individually and collaboratively.

                        <p>
                          The course is 12 weeks long with four hours of in-class time per week. The first half of the course will
                          provide a foundation in web languages, and the second half will involve application of 
                          the concepts through project work. 12 weeks sounds like a lot of time, but it comes down to less than 48 hours 
                          of class time to learn programming and finish a project! Using only class time will give students some
                          exposure to programming, but to truly move forward in the field, students should expect to devote time
                          of their own during and after the course for exploration.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The entire session is group-based.
                          I do realize group work can be challenging; however, working in groups is an essential
                          part of life and is particularly important in the programming world, so let's dive right 
                          in, get comfortable with it, and make it fun!
                        </p>

                          The language concepts during the first half of the course are presented in modules. Each module's content
                          is roughly a class period, but because students learn at their own pace, students should feel welcome to 
                          spend more or less time on a module as necessary. However, although the first few weeks may appear simple,
                          the material will quickly become challenging, so I recommend setting a brisk pace from
                          the start to leave ample room to absorb the later, more complicated, modules.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          To assess your programming comprehension, Mission Bit will offer occasional quizzes and assignments via 
                          Google Classroom. Students who keep up with the course modules should have no trouble with these assignments. 
                          If you run into difficulty completing them, however, let the instructor know and I'll help get you back on track.

                        <p>
                          My teaching philosophy is that students 
                          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiential_learning">learn best by doing</a>. I will work to facilitate 
                          groups, ensuring that students are engaging the content and their classmates effectively. I will offer lectures 
                          when necessary to clear up points of confusion, explain general concepts, and keep the class moving forward.
                          There will be adult mentors, volunteers and other Mission Bit staff present to assist in students' learning experience.

                          Lastly, if you have non-HTML/JS/CSS-related topics you'd like to discuss, including questions about other 
                          programming languages, hardware, computer history, machine learning (and so on), please find me before, 
                          after class, or via email. These topics are often theoretical, fascinating and deep, and can easily consume a 
                          significant chunk of class time and tend to leave students without prior knowledge out.

                          My main job as the class instructor, beyond simply facilitating the course content, is to ensure that everyone in class 
                          feels safe, comfortable and welcome. I encourage freedom of expression and creativity, 
                          realizing that sometimes in that process, misunderstandings can happen and feelings can be hurt.
                          I ask that all members of the class community work together to resolve any issues that may arise, 
                          and strive to be respectful and inclusive in their words and creations.

                              If you are interested in something, you will focus on it, and if you focus attention on anything, 
                              it is likely that you will become interested in it. Many of the things we find interesting are not 
                              so by nature, but because we took the trouble of paying attention to them.

                              might offer interesting insight. I'm not saying technology is definitely bad, but it's important to
                              understand your relationship to it, assess to what extent it's moving you towards your life goals and adjust 
                              your habits accordingly (easier said than done!).

                              When I work with primary school students, they tend to leap into coding. They don't
                              mind if they make mistakes along the way. Older students,
                              in contrast, are often worried about failing and may disengage. 
                              Approaching experiences with an eager, open attitude and without preconceptions is called

                              Some students are afraid of asking questions for a variety of reasons. If you don't ask questions,
                              it's worth asking yourself why!
