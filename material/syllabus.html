                          use the term "syllabus" if that didn't sound so formal!

                          The goal of this course is to learn the basics of computer programming by working in groups
                          to create a game or application using the languages of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                          Groups will present their work on Demo Day at the end of the semester.

                        <h2 id="how-this-course-works">How this course works</h2>
                        <p>
                          The course is 12 weeks long with four hours of in-class time per week. The first half of the course will
                          provide a foundation for using web languages, and the second half will involve application of 
                          the concepts through project work. The entire session is group-based.
                          I do realize group work can be painful for many (myself included!), but there's no avoiding it in life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The language concepts during the first half of the course are presented in modules. Each module's content
                          is roughly a class period, but because students learn at their own pace, students should feel welcome to 
                          spend more or less time on a module as necessary. I will work to facilitate the groups, ensuring that 
                          students are engaging the content and their classmates effectively. I will also offer lectures when necessary to
                          clear up points of confusion, explain general concepts, and keep the class moving forward. 
                          There will be adult mentors, volunteers and other Mission Bit staff present to assist in students' learning experience.

                        <p>
                          My main job as the class instructor, beyond simply facilitating the course content, is to ensure that everyone in class 
                          feels comfortable and welcome and to adhere to the values of inclusion that Mission Bit and Gateway High School stand for.
                          Throughout the course, I do use images, jokes, and memes from the internet to make the course more fun 
                          and engaging. I strive to ensure that my humor avoids negative stereotypes or hurtful content. Due to the nature
                          of such humor, however, it's possible that some content may inadvertently cause offense. If this occurs,
                          please let me know, and I'll remove all content in question immediately!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In turn, I ask that all members of the class community work together to resolve any issues that 
                          may arise, and strive to be respectful and inclusive.

                              will be covered in each class that it's very easy to fall behind missing one or two. If you have any 
                              concerns about attendance, bring them to the instructor's attention today and we'll work it out!

                              <b>Focus</b> is the key to learning stuff, whatever it may be. We all struggle with constant distractions from 
                              games, texting, 10-hour <i>Game of Thrones</i> marathons, etc. These things seem fun in the short run, 
                              but in the long run, the folks who get great at something make time for the important stuff.
                              It's a bit ironic that consuming computer-based content is one of the biggest barriers to learning how to 
                              make computer-based content.
