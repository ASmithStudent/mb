                          A common scenario: you've learned something new and unfamiliar with guidance,
                          then you're cut loose and asked to make a project! The big question is: how to move from that
                          structured environment and forge ahead under your own power? This module will hopefully
                          offer some guidance in that regard, but importantly, I (your instructor), your peers, and MB staff
                          and volunteers will be here to keep you on track, so as long as you're engaged, you'll be just fine!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Think back to the Choose Your Own Adventure game your group made at the beginning of the semester.
                          First, you planned out your game, then gathered necessary skills and resources, and coded it up.
                          Along the way, you may have run into a situation or two that forced you to change plans a bit, and 
                          you adapted. That's pretty much the plan here, too--plan, find resources, build, repeat (as necessary). 
                        </p>
                        <hr>
                        <h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>
                        <p>
                          Start by spending an hour or so to do intensive planning with your team.
                          Some questions to ask (it's OK if you can only make a partial answer for starters):
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Do we want to make a game or web application?</li>
                          <li>What is the purpose/goal of our game or application?</li>
                          <li>What type of features do you want your game or app to have?</li>
                          <li>What parts of the project is each group member interested in doing?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                          Your group may also benefit from a brainstorming session. An effective approach to brainstorming involves
                          everyone in the group writing down as many ideas as possible for 5 minutes in silence. Do not filter your
                          ideas at this stage--crazy is OK. After the idea-generating stage, the group will reconvene and discuss
                          the ideas to filter out the most engaging and practical of them. Voting, using a
                          process of elimination, or ranking system may be useful in this filtering stage. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Once you have an idea, try to simplify the idea as much as possible. You'll always be able to add new
                          features to whatever it is you make, but if the scope of your ideas is vast, it'll be much
                          harder to get momentum going and feel like you're making progress.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Another easy way to go about choosing a project is by doing your own version of a standard, classic
                          game or app. This more or less eliminates the problem of planning right away, and your
                          team can go right into finding resources and writing code. Check the <a href="../resources">resources page</a>
                          to get connected with some ideas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          I'd also like to speak frankly here: platformers and games with heavy physics components tend to be popular,
                          but these can be <i>very</i> challenging first projects, so I try to discourage them.
                          However, students tend to go for them anyway. One way to make a successful physics-based project
                          is to use a game framework, so I'll introduce one later in this module. Either way, we'll make it 
                          happen, but know that platformer usually means serious coding ahead!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Don't forget to use Google Docs or create a text file in your group's Github repository to organize
                          your ideas, resources, and todos as you work on the project.

                        <p>
                          Once you have a project goal, you can begin gathering resources. Are there any tutorials 
                          that apply to your game or application or to something similar? What technologies will be 
                          necessary? This can be a difficult task at first, since there are so many unknowns in the 
                          field, but I'll help you filter your research to hone in on valuable resources. The important
                          thing is working on your ability to collect, evaluate, filter, and utilize these resources; you'll be doing it
                          constantly throughout your programming journey. This website's <a href="../resources">resources</a>
                          page is a good place to start exploring!

                          And now, the fun part! Dive into writing your app as soon as you're confident with your plan
                          and have a few basic resources on hand. Getting started is the hardest part, and the key to getting ahead
                          is getting started. And, of course, the key to getting started is breaking the large task into smaller 
                          tasks and working on the easiest one.

                          A very important part of this process is ensuring everyone in the group is contributing!
                          Remember, your group is counting on you to step up and offer to help out every day. If you're not able
                          to find something to do at a given moment, head over to 
                          <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript">Codecademy</a> to improve your JS.
                          This will be helpful to your team later on. Playing games or surfing the net is going to distract
                          your teammates, so schedule a time outside of class to kick it with them to do that stuff.

                        <h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>
                        <p>
                          All right, let's talk technically from here out. First topic: debugging. I'm sure you've encountered
                          some error in your code so far--it's normal! The truth is, almost every program doesn't work at first. 
                          Debugging is a huge topic and, like computer programming itself, is just as much of an art as a science.
                        </p>  
                        <p>
                          The best way to debug is to avoid bugs in the first place. This means following clear logic,
                          planning, naming variables descriptively, organizing your project's logic in clear function and classes,
                          using comments, etc. Easy to say, hard to do.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          But when bugs inevitably do show up, they are a great opportunity to learn. The three kinds of bugs are 
                          syntax errors, runtime errors, and logic errors. Syntax errors are generally easy to fix: the browser's console (see
                          <a href="module5.html#developer-tools">module 5</a>) will show you the error explaining the problem 
                          and the line number it occured on. Your job is to go fix it. Often, it's a simple typo, although sometimes
                          it's a bit more involved, but basically it boils down to JS plain not understanding what you typed in. 
                          As you know by now, every letter matters, case sensitivity matters; it's totally unlike English, where you 
                          can pretty much misspell everything and folks generally know what you mean.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Runtime errors are when everything is typed to the language's syntactical standards, but at some point in the program,
                          the code attempts to do something that is disallowed. For example, if I pass strings into a
                          function that requires number input or I attempt to access an array element that doesn't exist, the program 
                          will crash. These errors can be trickier to navigate than syntax errors and require an understanding 
                          of your program's state--what values the variables
                          contain and what conditions are present when the error occurred. Resolving runtime errors uses techniques discussed
                          below, but with the advantage of JS providing a line number where the error was thrown.
                        </p>
                        <img src="http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/80/80ff000de170d180836519b11ef29b7814dc5d5b5b24abed94f5c3828075e811.jpg"
                          alt="Debugging meme" style="margin: 15px; max-width: 500px;">
                        <p>
                          Logic errors, on the other hand, occur when JS says your program is fine and dandy, no errors show in
                          the developer console, but your program still isn't behaving as you expect. Maybe a variable you're expecting
                          to have some value at some point in the code's execution doesn't have that value, or a conditional
                          you expect to be true is evaluating false. Resolving these types of bugs requires a bit of detective work
                          and problem-solving. These bugs are great because they force you to understand your program logic on a deeper level
                          than you do, and facing them head-on will really improve your programming skills. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Some concrete strategies for resolving these logic errors include inserting <code class="js">console.log()</code>
                          statements in your code and re-running your program to see if the value of variables and conditionals matches
                          your expectations. Sometimes, entire blocks of code aren't even executing, and a simple 
                          <code class="js">console.log("Is this even working?");</code> call in the code block in question
                          will tell you a lot about your program's state. The console also offers the ability to interactively type in a variable
                          name that exists in your program's global scope (i.e. isn't inside a function) and see information about it or 
                          execute test code. The console also allows breakpoints to be set (for Chrome, this feature is in the Sources tab
                          under "Show debugger"). This means that your code will stop running on the line(s) you've told it to, and you can
                          poke around and check variable values, conditionals, and so forth to diagnose your logic problem.

                          All in all, debugging is a very big topic, so this is just a taste of the agony and ecstacy in store for you.
                          Since this is an introductory course, as mentioned, we've got folks on hand to make these debugging procedures
                          as painless and educational as possible, so let a mentor or the instructor know if something is going
                          wrong, and we'll walk you through it!

                          Last topic: using Github and the command line. As with debugging, these are complex topics,
                          so I'm only offering a small taste of these tools. You know by now that Github can
                          host your website and store your code. You may also know that each time you upload code,
                          you've made something called a "commit," which is a version of a repository. Github is
                          basically an interface for a tool called git, which is operated by typing commands on
                          a text-only screen called a command prompt. This command prompt, without getting too technical,
                          is based on Unix, a really old and powerful operating system that Mac's OS is built on top of.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Using a prompt, you can navigate through folders and perform actions on files just like you can by clicking
                          on folders. To start a terminal session on Mac, click the magnifying glass in the top-right corner and type 
                          "terminal," or click on the shortcut link in your dock. When the screen appears, you'll see a command prompt
                          which shows your current directory (folder). You can show a list of the files in your directory by typing 
                          <code>ls</code> and you can change to another folder by typing <code>cd foldername</code>. If there are 
                          spaces in the folder name, use quotes. Feel free to check a basic course on terminal commands to learn
                          more useful things you can do on the command line.
