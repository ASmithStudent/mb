                        <p>
                          Welcome back! Now that we've got a couple of the basics in JavaScript and are getting
                          comfortable with our development environment, it's time to dive right into game
                          development. The idea is to introduce the remaining basics of programming in the context
                          of a graphical game. 
                        </p>  
                        <p>  
                          We're going to use JS's built-in graphics library, 
                          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element">Canvas</a>, to render the graphics.
                          Canvas is an ideal game framework to use because it's simple and no-frills, forcing us 
                          to understand and write all of the game mechanics from scratch. Later, we'll
                          be able to use a more complex game framework that will handle some of the work for us.
                        </p>  
                        <p>
                          A good way to start is to plan out the result on paper. The primary game mechanic works like this:
                          Using the mouse, a player will move a block left and right along the bottom of the screen, 
                          dodging falling blocks of different sizes and speeds. Every block that the player
                          avoids colliding with increases the player's score by 1. The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible. 
                        </p>
                        <hr>
                        <h2 id="hello-canvas">Hello, Canvas!</h2>
                        <p>
                          All graphics programs take a little bit of code to set up and show something on screen.
                          Luckily, canvas is about as minimal as it gets.  Don't worry too much about the specifics 
                          of the code--it'll make more sense later on, but I'll offer a provisional explanation below. 
                          Don't forget to copy the HTML and CSS portions. You're welcome to follow along with the code in 
                          <a href="https://codepen.io/">Codepen</a> or in your local environment. Don't forget to 
                          reference your <code>.js</code> script and <code>.css</code> stylesheet from your 
                          <code>.html</code> file if you're working locally.
                        </p>

                        </div>
                        <p>
                          There's a lot going on here! Let's break it down a bit. Don't worry if these explanations
                          are dense; they'll make more sense later on:
                        </p>
                        <h3>The HTML</h3>
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            <p>
                              The HTML component creates a new element we haven't seen yet,
                              <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>. The canvas is then given height and width attributes in HTML
                              rather than with CSS, which can cause image warping. This canvas element is also given
                              an ID of "paper" so it can be easily accessed in CSS and JS.
                            </p>  
                          </li>  
                        </ul>  
                        <h3>The CSS</h3>
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            <p>
                              The CSS component makes the screen colors dark, centers the canvas element, and gives it a border, as 
                              discussed in <a href="class3.html#flexbox-centering">class 3</a>.
                            </p>
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                          That's about all we'll really need in terms of HTML and CSS for the remainder of the semester!
                        </p>
                        <h3>The JS</h3>
                        <p>Now we begin looking at the JS, which is where all the action is.</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            <p>
                              First order of business is a comment stating the purpose of the game. This is also a good place
                              to put lists of team members, helpful links, things to do, etc.
                            </p>
                          </li>  
                          <li>
                            <p>
                              Next line has a string, <code class="javascript">"use strict";</code>. This tells the JS 
                              <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine">interpreter</a></i>, or the program 
                              built into the browser that executes the JS code, to disallow some common brittle programming 
                              practices. Be sure to add this line to the top of all of your JS scripts. 
                              <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_strict.asp">Read more</a> 
                              on <code class="javascript">"use strict";</code> if you're curious.
                            </p>
                          </li> 
                          <li>
                            <p>
                              The following line,
                              <div style="margin: 15px;">
                                <pre><code class="javascript">let canvas = document.getElementById("paper");</code></pre>
                              </div>
                            <p>
                              requests some information from the HTML document object using one of its functions,
                              <code class="javascript">getElementById()</code>, which looks for an element
                              with an ID matching the parameter string, in this case, <code class="javascript">"paper"</code>.
                              This function returns a structure called an <i>object</i>, one of the most
                              important programming concepts, and stores this object in a new variable called 
                              <code class="javascript">canvas</code>. We'll discuss much more about objects later, but
                              suffice to say they are collections of pieces of information (variables) and actions (functions) that
                              work together as a unit.
                            </p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p>
                              The line,
                            </p>
                              <div style="margin: 15px;">
                                <pre><code class="js">let ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");</code></pre>
                              </div>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              stores another object in a variable for us to use. This time, we're calling on the 
                              <code class="js">getContext()</code> function inside of our new 
                              <code class="js">canvas</code> object. This function returns a canvas context 
                              object, which is what we will use to draw on the canvas. We call this variable
                              <code class="js">ctx</code> for short since we'll be typing it frequently.
                            </p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p>
                              Now that we have a canvas context object to work with, we can begin drawing using its
                              built-in properties and functions. The line,
                            </p>  
                            <div style="margin: 15px;">
                              <pre><code class="js">ctx.fillStyle = "#ffffff";</code></pre>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                              Sets the drawing color of the canvas to white.
                            </p>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            <p>
                              And the final line, 
                            </p>  
                            <div style="margin: 15px;">
                              <pre><code class="js">ctx.fillRect(100, 100, 70, 50);</code></pre>
                            </div>
                            <p>
                              draws a filled, white rectangle on the screen. The canvas context <code class="js">fillRect()</code> 
                              function takes four parameters, something we haven't seen yet. Remember that 
                              parameters are pieces of data that change the way the function works. These 
                              parameters are numbers which describe the location and size of the rectangle to be 
                              drawn. The first two numbers represent the x and y coordinates for the top-left of the 
                              rectangle. The second two numbers represent the width and height of the rectangle. 
                              All of these units are in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel">pixels</a>, the little
                              dots on the computer screen that form an image.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Another thing to note is that the coordinate plane is arranged in canvas in a different
                              manner than a Cartesian geometric plane:
                            </p>  
                            <img alt="Image showing the difference between the traditional and canvas coordinate planes" style="margin: 15px;"
                              src="https://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1393985491canvas-coordinate-space.png">
                            <p>    
                              With this in mind, try changing the four parameters of <code class="js">fillRect()</code> 
                              to draw rectangles at different locations and of different sizes. Try changing the color
                              value assigned to <code class="js">fillStyle()</code>. See if you can draw more rectangles by
                              repeating these two lines multiple times.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              By the way, I have a <a href="../code/coordinates/">tool</a> which will display the x y coordinates 
                              of an image. This might come in handy later on when you're trying to put things at
                              specific places in your game.
                            </p>
                          </li>
                        </ul>  
                        <hr style="clear: both;">
                        <h2 id="adding-animation">Adding animation</h2>
                        <p>
                          So now we have a square on our canvas! Let's make it move.
                        </p>  
                        <p>
                          Here's the truth: all animation is a bit of a smoke-and-mirrors game; if you show a picture of a person 
                          for a split second, then show another picture of that person after they've moved slightly for another split second
                          and repeat the process, you create the illusion of motion.
                        </p>

                          And that's exactly what we'll do on our canvas. To do so, we'll need two tools:
                          <ol>
                            <li>
                              number variables to keep track of the square's x and y position on the screen
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              some kind of way for the program to draw the screen over a period of time
                            </li>
                          </ol>
                        </p>  
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
